**Project Description:**

Crop Pest Detection using CNN and Explainable AI is an intelligent system designed to identify crop pests from image data using deep learning techniques. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the model is trained to classify various pest types that commonly affect crops, enabling early intervention and informed pest management.
To enhance trust and interpretability, the project incorporates LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), a powerful explainability tool that visually highlights the parts of an image that most influenced the model's prediction. This makes the system not only accurate but also understandable for researchers, agronomists, and farmers.

**Key Features:**

1.Accurate pest classification using CNN

2.Supports multiple pest categories from agricultural datasets

3.LIME-based model explanation for interpretability

4.Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

5.Modular and well-organized code for easy adaptation

**Use Case:**

This project is intended for use in:

Smart agriculture platforms

Mobile or web-based pest detection tools

AI research in agricultural diagnostics
